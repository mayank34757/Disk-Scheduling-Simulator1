# Disk-Scheduling-Simulator
This repository contains a Disk Scheduling Simulator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project visualizes different disk scheduling algorithms used in operating systems to manage disk head movements efficiently.

Features
Algorithms Implemented:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)

SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)

C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)

Interactive UI:

Users can input disk requests and select a scheduling algorithm.

Displays the seek sequence and total seek time.

Real-time Visualization:

A graph generated using Chart.js to visualize disk head movement.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Visualization: Chart.js

How to Use
Enter the initial head position.

Provide the disk request sequence (space-separated values).

Select a scheduling algorithm from the dropdown menu.

Click "Simulate" to visualize the disk scheduling process.

Future Improvements
Adding more disk scheduling algorithms like LOOK and C-LOOK.

Improving UI for better user experience.

Providing an option to save results as a file.
